# InstaChain
A decentralized, real-time 2nd layer sidechain with instant transaction confirmations and near 0 fees, with a 2-way peg so you can deposit and withdraw btc directly to and from the btc network. It features a decentralized, non-distributed architecture that enables anyone to run a node (a.k.a their own sidechain) and process transactions. Node operators do not need any permission to run a node, and users can connect to any (1 or more) node they choose to.
