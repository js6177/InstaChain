  InstaChain is new open source Layer 2 sidechain built on bitcoin. Transactions are confirmed instantly, individually (as opposed to multiple in a block), and settle on the bitcoin base layer with fees as low as 1 sat.
  <br>
  It is an open protocol instead of a proprietary product (where 1 company runs it) or a federated blockchain (where multiple approved members run it). Anyone can run a node!
  <br>
  You can find the repo here: <a href="https://github.com/js6177/InstaChain">https://github.com/js6177/InstaChain</a>

  To test it out, follow the tutorial in the <a href= "https://github.com/js6177/InstaChain/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> file. If you want to run your own node, there are instructions in <a href= "https://github.com/js6177/InstaChain/blob/master/Node/SettingUpNode.txt">\Node\SettingUpNode.txt</a>
